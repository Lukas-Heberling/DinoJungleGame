# ðŸ¦– DinoJungleGame ðŸŒ´

A small plattformer written in python using pygame

I'm on holiday right now and I just felt like writing a little game again...
I won't have much time, as I'll probably spend most of my time learning to surf. But still, this can be a really fun project! I am excited to see what will come out of it
